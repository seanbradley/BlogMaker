####Terraform script and configuration files.


###ABOUT BLOGMAKER

BlogMaker is a simple cloud configuration utility leveraging Terraform by Hashicorp. You can learn more about Terraform here:

<https://www.terraform.io/>

Examples of a variety of architectures that can be spun up with Terraform can be found in Hashicorp's repo here:

<https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/examples>

###TECHNOLOGY STACK
This example, here, specifies AWS as the provider, and instantiates a given number (default = 1) of EC2 instance(s) (Ubuntu Precise 12.04-i386), a single SQL database, and an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). The goal: rapid spin-up of brand-spankin' new, fully-featured, skinnable, and potentially scalable websites in the cloud suitable for the average small business client.

###INSTALLATION
1) Download and unzip Terraform's zipped installation files from the Hashicorp site into your chosen directory

2) Assuming you're working on Linux, add Terraform's binaries to your path, like so...

    $pwd
    /home/seanbradley/Projects/tf
    $export PATH=/home/seanbradley/Projects/tf:$PATH

3) Check to see if it's installed correctly by entering the following in the CLI...

    $terraform

4) Clone this repo into and tweak per your needs.

5) You need an AWS account to make this work, of course. Once you have an AWS SECRET_KEY and AWS ACCESS_KEY, you'll need to create a separate terraform.tfvars file to contain these variables, like so:

    $cd ~/blogmaker
    $touch terraform.tfvars

Edit terraform.tvars to include...

    access_key = "your_access_key_here"
    secret_key = "your_secret_key_here"
    
Make sure to include terraform.tfvars in your .gitignore file. Secret keys should not be included in version control.
